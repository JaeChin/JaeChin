# Hey, I'm Jaedon 👋🏾

MIS senior at Texas Southern University, graduating May 2026. CompTIA Security+ certified.

I build things that work — whether that's racking Cisco switches in a server room or shipping a full-stack CRM with role-based auth. My day job is cybersecurity infrastructure at TSU. Nights and weekends, I build software and automation systems.

## What I Do

**At work** — I'm a Cybersecurity Infrastructure Support Technician at TSU, where I built the university's first dedicated cybersecurity teaching lab from the ground up. Cisco Catalyst 9200/8200, Meraki MS130, Firepower 1000 firewalls, UCS C220 servers, VLAN segmentation — all documented for long-term handoff.

**On my own** — I run a self-hosted VPS with Docker infrastructure powering automation workflows, AI agent orchestration, and personal projects. I like building tools that solve real problems, not just tutorials.

## Projects

🔒 **TSU Cybersecurity Lab** — Designed and deployed enterprise-grade network infrastructure for student security training. Cisco routing/switching, firewall policy, physical rack buildout, full documentation.

🏗️ **R-Value CRM** — Full-stack CRM for service contractors. Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, PostgreSQL with Row Level Security. Role-based auth, job costing, real access controls — not a toy app.

🤖 **AI Security Automation Platform** — Multi-agent system with a controller/worker architecture. One model plans, specialized workers execute. Log analysis, security study assistance, automated workflows. Built on n8n + Docker.

🏀 **Rockets Loyalty+** *(NBA Tech Challenge — 1st Place)* — Led a team as primary developer. Built a fan loyalty app with Next.js and Supabase. 20+ hours of development, user personas, empathy mapping. Taught prompt engineering to participating students.

📱 **TSU TigerMate** — Mobile student companion app built with React Native/Expo and TypeScript. Dashboard, task management, event tracking — designed around real student needs.

🤖 **JettBot** — Python Discord bot. Because sometimes you just build stuff for fun.

## Where I'm Headed

Cybersecurity and cloud infrastructure engineering — with a focus on government, defense, and GovTech environments. I care about building systems that are secure by default, documented for the next person, and actually work under pressure.
